# Platform
ARM64 Custom Linux & Secure Content Verification Platform

Overview

This portfolio documents my hands-on work on a security-focused systems engineering project to build a custom Linux distribution for ARM64 architecture with an integrated content verification platform. The work demonstrates practical skills in low-level systems programming, security hardening, and full-stack development with a focus on supply chain security and information integrity.

Project Purpose & Reality Check

The primary goal was to create a secure, self-contained system that minimized external dependencies and attack surfaces. Rather than building a complete Web3 ecosystem, we focused on creating foundational infrastructure with these practical objectives:

Eliminate Supply Chain Risks: Build from source to avoid third-party vulnerabilities
Create Unique Attack Surface: Custom components make automated attacks difficult
Ensure Information Quality: AI verification maintains content reliability
Prove Technical Capability: Demonstrate systems engineering through practical implementation
