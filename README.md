## Overview

A custom Linux distribution targeted at **ARM64** with an integrated **secure content verification platform**.  
The system is built from source, hardened for reduced attack surface, and includes an AI-assisted verification stack for ensuring information integrity.

---

## What the project is

- **Custom ARM64 Linux build**
  - Full from-source build of base system and selected userspace
  - Hardened kernel configuration and minimal runtime footprint
  - Controlled dependency graph and reproducible build artefacts

- **Secure content verification platform**
  - Pipeline that ingests, evaluates and attests content using deterministic checks and AI-assisted validators
  - Native integration with the OS for on-device integrity checks and signed provenance
  - Modular APIs for service or application integration

- **Supply-chain & runtime protections**
  - Reproducible builds and artefact signing
  - Dependency auditing and provenance tracking
  - Runtime hardening and reduced attack surface through minimal services

---

## Capabilities

- Build-from-source OS for ARM64 with audit-ready artefacts  
- Native content verification and attestation services  
- Extensible verification APIs for integration with higher-level systems (e.g., payment/currency layers)  
- Reproducible, signed delivery pipeline for secure deployment

---

## Technical highlights

- Cross-compilation toolchains and automated build scripts  
- Custom kernel patches and secure configuration profiles  
- Deterministic build outputs and signature workflows  
- AI-assisted verification components combined with deterministic checks  
- Modular architecture that separates verification, storage and networking concerns
