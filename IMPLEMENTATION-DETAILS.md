Technical Implementation

Custom Linux Distribution for ARM64

Build Automation & Practical Challenges

Adapted Automated Linux From Scratch (ALFS) for ARM64 architecture
Solved 3-5 specific manual intervention points in the ALFS process:

Cross-compilation toolchain setup for aarch64
Kernel configuration adjustments for ARM-specific hardware
Bootloader (U-Boot) customization for target devices
Architecture-specific package compilation issues
Filesystem and partition table configuration
System Architecture Decisions

Minimalist Approach: BusyBox-based rootfs with essential components only
Security-First Configuration: Custom kernel compiled with unnecessary features disabled
ARM64 Optimization: Tailored for embedded and server ARM applications
.NET Application - Zero External Dependencies

Practical Implementation Choices

Developed entire web platform using pure .NET without NuGet packages
Built custom solutions for common framework needs:

Manual JSON serialization/deserialization
Custom database access layers (avoiding Entity Framework)
Self-contained authentication and session management
Native .NET logging and diagnostics
Security Benefits Realized

Complete code transparency and auditability
No vulnerability risks from third-party library updates
Reduced attack surface from complex dependency chains
AI-Powered Content Verification System

Actual Implementation

Integrated open-source AI models for content analysis
Developed correlation algorithms against verified information
Implemented points-based reputation system for user contributions
Built dynamic scoring that adjusts based on new verified information
Practical Scope (What Was Actually Built)

Working content verification and scoring system
User reputation and contribution tracking
Real-time content quality assessment
Points-based reward mechanism
Planned Extension (Not Implemented)

Web3 token conversion of reputation points
Blockchain integration for decentralized governance
51% attack prevention through economic distribution
