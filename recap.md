## Systems Engineering

- **ARM64 LFS automation**
  - Automated an Automated-Linux-From-Scratch (ALFS/LFS) workflow for aarch64 with pragmatic manual-intervention solutions for tricky steps.
- **Bootable custom Linux distribution**
  - Produced a bootable, hardened image tailored to target hardware and use-cases.
- **Cross-architecture build system**
  - Cross-compilation toolchains and reproducible builds for ARM64 targets.
- **Production-ready deployment pipeline**
  - Reproducible artefacts, signing and CI/CD pipelines designed for reliable rollouts.

---

## Application Development

- **Complete .NET platform without external dependencies**
  - All application code written without NuGet/third-party packages to preserve auditability.
- **Custom authentication and data-access layers**
  - Self-contained session/auth systems and bespoke DB-access layers avoiding ORMs.
- **AI integration for content verification**
  - On-platform AI models and correlation logic for real-time content analysis.
- **Real-time user reputation system**
  - Live scoring, provenance-aware reputation tracking and a points-based reward mechanism.

---

## Security Implementation

- **Unique system fingerprint through customisation**
  - Custom kernel builds, bespoke services and non-standard server behaviours to reduce common exploitability.
- **Active traffic monitoring and analysis**
  - GeoIP-enriched ingress, hop-chain provenance and anomaly detection feeding verification and incident workflows.
- **Minimal, auditable codebase**
  - Reduced dependency surface and fully reviewable internal implementations for core functionality.
- **Defence-in-depth architecture**
  - Layered controls from boot chain to application logic, plus reproducible builds and artefact signing.

## Summary

A cohesive engineering effort combining ARM64 system engineering, a dependency-free .NET application stack, integrated AI verification and a layered security posture. The result is a bootable, auditable platform optimised for trust, resilience and operational clarity.
