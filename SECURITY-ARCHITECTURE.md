## Production Implementation

- **Customised NGINX configuration** with deliberate non-standard behaviour patterns to reduce signatureable attack vectors.  
- **GeoIP integration** for traffic monitoring, provenance enrichment and region-aware threat detection.  
- **Full-stack platform** implementing bespoke business logic (ingest, verification, reputation and scoring).  
- **Comprehensive CI/CD**: automated testing, build-from-source pipelines and reproducible deployment workflows.

## Security Philosophy in Practice

The platform follows a pragmatic, *security-first* posture: minimise external trust, maximise auditability, and reduce predictable attack surfaces.

### Actually implemented security measures
- **Supply-chain control**  
  - All platform components are built from verified source; binary provenance is enforced and artefacts are signed.
- **Minimal attack surface**  
  - Custom kernel builds and a BusyBox-based runtime contain only essential features and services.
- **Application hardening**  
  - Non-standard web server behaviour and bespoke application logic to make commodity exploits ineffective.
- **Monitoring & detection**  
  - Geo-aware tracking and anomaly detection feed the verification and incident pipelines.
- **Code integrity**  
  - .NET application contains zero third-party dependencies; internal implementations replace common packages to maintain auditability.

## Security Through Practical Uniqueness

Security gains are realised through **practical uniqueness** rather than secrecy. By using custom-compiled components, tailored kernel configurations and specially crafted application logic, the system reduces the usefulness of off-the-shelf exploit tooling and automated scanners. This does not obviate good security hygiene â€” it complements it by increasing the effort an attacker needs to succeed.

## Deployment & Operational Notes

- **Testing**: Unit, integration and system tests run in CI against reproducible build artefacts.  
- **Deployment**: Reproducible images and signed artefacts are deployed via automated pipelines; configuration is templated for systemd or container orchestration.  
- **Monitoring**: Provenance logs, GeoIP events and anomaly alerts are collected centrally and retained according to policy.  
- **Privacy & compliance**: Geo and IP data handling follows data-minimisation, retention and access control practices required by relevant legislation.

## Summary

A production-grade web infrastructure that emphasises source-level control, minimal dependencies, and operational auditability. The combination of custom NGINX ingress, GeoIP enrichment, hardened OS and dependency-free application logic forms a pragmatic, layered defence tailored to reduce common supply-chain and exploitation risks.
