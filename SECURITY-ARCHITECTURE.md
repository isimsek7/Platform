Web Infrastructure & Security

Production Implementation

GeoIP integration for traffic monitoring and threat detection
Full-stack platform with custom business logic
Comprehensive testing and deployment pipelines


Security Philosophy in Practice

Actually Implemented Security Measures

Supply Chain Control: All components built from verified source code
Minimal Attack Surface: Custom kernel and application with only essential features
Application Hardening: Non-standard web server configurations
Monitoring Capabilities: Geographic tracking and anomaly detection
Code Integrity: Zero third-party dependencies in .NET application
Security Through Practical Uniqueness

The system's security derives from its custom natureâ€”attackers cannot use standard exploits against unique kernel configurations, custom-compiled services, and specially crafted application logic.
